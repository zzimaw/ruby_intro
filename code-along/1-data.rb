# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

# Non-numbers

# True, False

# Nothing

# Variables

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation

# # put the number 2 on screen
# puts 2

# #put our favorite food on screen
# puts "tacos"

# #true and false value
# puts true
# puts false 

# # store the number 5 in memory
# x = 5

# # store the number 2 in memory
# y = 2

# #multiply the two numbers and show them on screen
# puts x*y

# store my fav food in memory
favorite_food = "tacos"

# write my fav food to screen
puts favorite_food

#store the number of tacos
number_of_tacos = 5

#write my food order to the screen
my_order = "#{number_of_tacos}... #{favorite_food}"

puts my_order
